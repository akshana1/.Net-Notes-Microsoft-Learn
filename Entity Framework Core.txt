Introduction to Entity Framework Core
ORM Framework:

EF Core is an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework for .NET applications.
Bridges the gap between the application's object-oriented model and the database's relational model.
Cross-Platform and Lightweight:

Designed to work on multiple platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux).
Lighter and more modular compared to its predecessor, Entity Framework 6.
Basic Concepts
DbContext:

Represents a session with the database, handling connections and transactions.
Contains DbSet<T> properties representing the database tables/entities.
Entities:

C# classes representing database tables.
Properties of entities map to columns in the database.
Configuration:

Fluent API or Data Annotations used for configuring entity relationships, column types, etc.
CRUD Operations
Querying Data:

LINQ (Language Integrated Query) used for querying databases in EF Core.
Supports querying using LINQ methods or query syntax against entity sets.
Adding and Updating Data:

DbContext methods such as Add(), Attach(), Update() used for adding/updating entities.
Change tracking automatically manages updates to the database.
Deleting Data:

Remove() method in DbContext used for deleting entities.
Cascading delete behavior configurable for relationships.
Migrations and Database Schema Management
Migrations:

Automatic or explicit creation of migration files to track changes in the data model.
Applying migrations using the dotnet ef migrations command.
Database Creation and Updates:

Database created or updated based on the defined entity models.
Ability to apply migrations to update the database schema without data loss.
Advanced Features
Relationships:

Configuring one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships between entities.
Handling navigation properties and their configurations.
Query Performance Optimization:

Techniques like eager loading, lazy loading, and explicit loading to optimize queries.
Use of Include(), ThenInclude(), and AsNoTracking() methods.
Transactions:

Managing transactions using TransactionScope or explicit BeginTransaction() methods.
Ensuring atomicity and consistency of database operations.
Additional Considerations
Logging and Error Handling:

Logging EF Core queries and operations for debugging purposes.
Handling exceptions and error states in EF Core operations.
Cross-cutting Concerns:

Implementing validation, authorization, and caching in EF Core operations.
Utilizing dependency injection and services for reusable functionalities.
EF Core serves as a powerful ORM framework simplifying database interactions
