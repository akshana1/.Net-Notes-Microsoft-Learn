Introduction to C#:

Overview of C# as an object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft.
Syntax similarities to C and C++, making it familiar for developers from these backgrounds.

Basic Syntax and Structure:

Variables, data types, and their declarations.
Control flow statements (if, else, switch, loops).
Methods, functions, and their usage.
Exception handling using try-catch blocks.

Object-Oriented Concepts:

Classes, objects, and constructors.
Inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.
Interfaces and abstract classes.

Data Structures and Collections:

Arrays, lists, dictionaries, queues, and stacks.
Enumerations and their usage.
Working with collections using LINQ (Language Integrated Query).

Advanced C# Features:

Generics and their applications in writing reusable code.
Delegates, events, and lambda expressions.
Asynchronous programming using async/await for handling asynchronous operations.
File I/O and Exception Handling:

Reading from and writing to files.
Handling exceptions and implementing custom exception classes.
Working with C# and .NET Framework:

Utilizing .NET Framework libraries and classes for common tasks.
Interoperability with other languages in the .NET ecosystem.

Memory Management and Garbage Collection:

Understanding the role of the CLR in managing memory.
Garbage collection and its impact on memory usage in C# programs.

Debugging and Testing:

Debugging techniques using IDEs like Visual Studio.
Writing unit tests using testing frameworks like NUnit or MSTest.

Best Practices and Patterns:

Coding conventions and best practices in C# programming.
Design patterns and their implementations in C#.

Web Development with C# (optional, if interested):

Introduction to ASP.NET and ASP.NET Core for web development.
Building web applications, RESTful APIs, and MVC (Model-View-Controller) patterns.



-------Examples---------

using System;

class HelloWorld
{
    static void Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, World!");
    }
}


Variables and Data Types:

int number = 10;
double pi = 3.14;
string message = "C# is fun!";
bool isTrue = true;
char letter = 'A';

Basic Arithmetics Operations:

int a = 10;
int b = 5;
int sum = a + b;
int difference = a - b;
int product = a * b;
double division = (double)a / b;
int remainder = a % b;

Conditional Statements:

int x = 15;

if (x > 10)
{
    Console.WriteLine("x is greater than 10");
}
else if (x == 10)
{
    Console.WriteLine("x is equal to 10");
}
else
{
    Console.WriteLine("x is less than 10");
}


For Loops:

for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Count: " + i);
}

While Loops:

int j = 0;
while (j < 5)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Count: " + j);
    j++;
}


Arrays:

int[] numbers = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
string[] names = new string[3];
names[0] = "Alice";
names[1] = "Bob";
names[2] = "Charlie";

Methods:

int Add(int a, int b)
{
    return a + b;
}

double CalculateCircleArea(double radius)
{
    return Math.PI * radius * radius;
}


Classes and Objects

class Person
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }

    public void Greet()
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello, my name is " + Name + " and I am " + Age + " years old.");
    }
}

// Creating an object of the Person class
Person person1 = new Person();
person1.Name = "Alice";
person1.Age = 30;
person1.Greet();
